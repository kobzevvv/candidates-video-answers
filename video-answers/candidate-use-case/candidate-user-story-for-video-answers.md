After completing a quiz, the candidate is seamlessly redirected to a video interview experience:

✅ They see a short “Checking your profile…” screen for ~3 seconds, reducing anxiety and confirming their submission is being reviewed.

✅ Behind the scenes, our system uses their quiz data (email, name) to trigger a Hireflix invitation via API.

✅ A follow-up message explains that they’ll now access the video interview platform — and can record answers immediately or later.

🔗 The candidate is then redirected to their personal Hireflix interview link. A copy of the link is also sent to their email.
